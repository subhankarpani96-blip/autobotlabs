# AutobotLabs Website

This is a ready-to-publish static website for **AutobotLabs** (dark theme).

## What's included
- `index.html` — main website (dark theme), ready to upload to GitHub Pages.
- `assets/` — folder for future images or logo files.
- `README.md` — this file.

## How to publish on GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a GitHub account at https://github.com if you don't have one.
2. Create a new repository named `autobotlabs`.
3. Upload all files from this folder to the repository (you can drag & drop in the web UI).
4. Go to the repository Settings → Pages (or Pages on left sidebar).
5. Under "Build and deployment", choose `Deploy from a branch`, select branch `main` (or `master`) and folder `/ (root)`.
6. Save. GitHub will provide a URL like `https://yourusername.github.io/autobotlabs/` within a minute or two.
7. Open that URL to see your live site.

## How to replace placeholders
- In `index.html`, replace `GUMROAD_LINK` with your Gumroad product link when ready.
- Replace `FREE_GUIDE_LINK` with your free guide link or an email capture endpoint.
- Replace the contact email if needed.

## Add a custom domain (optional)
1. Buy a domain (e.g. autobotlabs.com) from a registrar.
2. In GitHub repo Settings → Pages → Custom domain, enter your domain.
3. Follow GitHub's instructions to add A/CNAME records at your domain registrar.

## Need help?
If you want, I can:
- Upload this repo to GitHub for you (I'll provide instructions and the files).
- Add Google Analytics code.
- Convert this into a multi-page WordPress theme or Carrd blocks.
